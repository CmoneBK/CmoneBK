- 👋 Hi, I’m @CmoneBK
- 🧑🏻‍🏫 I'm teacher at Berfuskolleg Erkelenz in Germany (a vocational education school) and I do teach mechanical engineering stuff, but not IT stuff.
- 👀 I’m interested in didactics, VR, AR, AI(🤗,֎) as long as you can create something with it. Well I do game too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python but learning is a big word for it of CHATGPT does all the work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much everything I'm doing.
- 📫 How to reach me. Well, putting this data out into the public is a bad idea for a teacher.
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can't really code 🤷‍♂️. But I'm trying. 😁
